What t ask before start solving problem
1) what is the datatype of input (int, float etc)
2) what is limit of input
3) how input is distributed
4) are there any duplicates
5) how much memory is available (in low memory case read data in chunks and do parallel processing on chunks if possible)
6) constraints and edge cases.


# sliding window:
in sliding window technique,

# pre-calculation/pre-processing:
this technique is used to reduce runtime complexity of some algorightms, here we do some calculations in advance, which is ging to be used later.
if we take example of tapping water algo,There we are storing left most and right most max elem intially,
because if we find left most and right most inside loop where we are calculating water storing area,
then our solution become n^2. so to avoid that we precalculated it and our solution become n.

# prefix sum:
we create a list which contains sum of prefix elements
for example: [1,2,3] will be [1,3,6], then now if want to get sum of elements of any subset of [1,2,3] we can simply use below formula
to get output in o(1); sum of subsets from i to j elements will be = prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[i-1]

# kadane algo:
this algo is used to find subset with max at index i.
formula  = max(max_sum_so_far{or max_sum_before_index_i}, max_sum_so_far+i)
