# rclone for move/copy/file files from one cloud to another or on-prem to cloud.
# use-case example:  we can use it for archival process like moving files after sometime from your server to some bucket
# like S3 . and if we need those files, we can restore it back again to our server.
# note: same kind of thing we can perform using s3 console as well. but rclone make our app cloud agnostic.


# we can integrate jira board with github, to automate the project status.(move to dev status when commit made,
# mark complete when pr merged)

# we can integrate jenkins with github to build and deploy new package after new commit in specific branch.

# we can integrate app-scan with jenkins, for jenkins build vulnerability check.

# cockroachdb for db and resdis for cahce
# minio for bucket service,
# liquibse for db-migrations,

# #### all cloud native tools and application for development and deployment : https://landscape.cncf.io/   #######


# trivy and twistlock are tools for vulnerability scanning in host settings, configuration, libraries and docker images
# in kubernetes environment.
