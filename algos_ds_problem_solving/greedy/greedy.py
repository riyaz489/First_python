# In greedy algos basically we chose whatever is the best for now, in given options.
# this is used where we have to obtain maximum value of something or to get optimal results.
# note: but being greedy does not always gives optimal results.
# but greedy works for :
# 1. activity selection
# 2. fractional knapsack
# 3. job sequencing
# 4 prims algo (discussed in graphs)
# 5. kruskal algo (discussed in graphs)
# 6. dijkstra algo (discussed in graphs)
# 7. huffman coding

# structure for greedy code.
# get optimal():
# res = 0
# while (all items are not considered)
#   i = selectAnItem()
#   if (feasible(i)):
#        res=res+1
# return res
