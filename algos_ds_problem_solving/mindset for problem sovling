# Fermi estimation: to roughly estimate anything
1. write all the equations we know and needed for given problem.
2. always take assumption in power of 10.
3. always have some reason for given assumption. example apple users are 1/3 because android dominant the market,
    so their users will be 2/3.
4. always do numerical comparisons.
5. if you don't have any assumption for current object then use whatever u know and try to make relation with that.
   for example if I can't estimate population of up, because I don't have any idea. but I do know population of uttarakhand.
   which is around 10 million, and we know up is greater than uttarakhand in area, also UP is very dense in compare to UK
   means in small areas lot of people are living. so we can say it's population will be around 1 billion.
